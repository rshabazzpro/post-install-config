</p>
<p>
In the initial step, I established a "Supreme Admin" role within osTicket, granting the role members unrestricted access to all functionalities, allowing them to perform any task or assignmentâ€”a state of complete access.

<p>
In this step, I created a department specifically for system administrators, who are the designated individuals capable of addressing and resolving these issues.

<p>
Here, I'm currently in the process of forming a Level II support team, as illustrated in the image above.

</p>
<p>
Here, as demonstrated, I established a new agent named John Doe. John Doe's access is limited, allowing him to view tickets and be a member of the support team, as indicated in the image above. Before creating John Doe, I also configured another agent named Jane Doe, who has supreme access and is a member of the sys-admin department.

<p>
In this final step, I'll be demonstrating how to configure SLAs. For this specific SLA, I've configured it with a severity level of A, including a 1-hour grace period, and it is scheduled to be completed within a day's time.
